## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`simpit_ortho_agent`** package: per-machine ortho scenery cache
  agent (see `docs/ORTHO_AGENT.md`). Subscribes to the X-Plane
  master's position over RREF (ground track, not heading) and keeps a
  moving bubble of Ortho4XP atlases warm in the local rclone VFS cache
  — rings in atlas units around the aircraft and its 45 s along-track
  projection, mixed-zoom aware via a per-folder textures index
  (airport patches ride along with the base). One primer thread does
  8 MB sequential first reads then cheap keep-warm touches; eviction
  is left entirely to rclone's LRU size cap (the agent issues no rc
  eviction calls and never writes the cache dir — bulk evictions have
  crashed X-Plane before). Includes fallback mount supervision with
  double-mount safety, a SIM_OFFLINE/IDLE/ACTIVE state machine, and
  fleet config re-reads on each sim return. Ships as
  `simpit-ortho-agent` (console script + PyInstaller spec).
- **`simpit_common.tilemath`** — pure slippy-tile / atlas math shared
  by the agent and the live verifier; **`simpit_common.xp_rref`** —
  shared RREF wire helpers (extracted from the probe engine).
- Live ortho-chain checks now exercise the production tilemath/index
  code when run from a checkout (stdlib fallback copies remain for the
  bare two-file slave deployment), understand the
  whole-Custom-Scenery-junction layout, and compare the VFS cache to
  the per-machine `cache_max_gb` instead of a hardcoded cap.

- **`make_dummy_scenery`** standard script: builds a dummy-texture
  mirror of the ortho Custom Scenery for the X-Plane master (flight
  model machine) — identical `zOrtho4XP_Z*` folder names, DSFs and
  `.ter` files copied, every `textures/*.dds` atlas replaced by a
  ~300-byte uniform-color DXT1 stand-in, masks copied, Ortho4XP build
  intermediates and `*.bak` skipped. Incremental via per-folder
  `.simpit_dummy.json` markers (re-runs build only new tiles), with
  `--verify`, `--prune`, `--only`, `--dry-run`, `--color`, and a
  refusal to write anywhere inside the real scenery tree. Folder names
  match `set_scenery_profile.py`'s scanner, so the master's
  `scenery_packs.ini` is managed unchanged (covered by tests).
- Installer now deploys the ortho cache agent with the Ortho Scenery
  Cache step: installs `simpit-ortho-agent.exe`, seeds the machine's
  local `ortho_agent.json` from the mount answers (fleet folder
  derived as `\\<host>\<share-root>\simpit`; master stays localhost),
  and registers a titled console wrapper under HKCU Run. Upgrades and
  uninstall stop the agent first.
- Ortho agent: the fleet config is now polled every ~60 s, so settings
  saved in Control's Ortho Cache dialog apply to running agents within
  a minute — tuning fields in place, endpoint fields via an automatic
  internal restart (feed/primer rebuilt from the new config). The
  dialog notes the behavior.
- Ortho agent: tier-1 flight-plan awareness (`waypoint_lookahead`,
  default on, dialog checkbox). The lookahead ring aims at the active
  GPS waypoint — bearing derived from the nose-relative GPS needle
  plus true heading, so magnetic variation stays out of the math —
  and swings onto the next leg the moment a waypoint sequences,
  seconds before the flown track gets there. Falls back to the ground
  track with no active waypoint (GPS refs read 0) or when the waypoint
  is >90° off-track (just-sequenced overshoot, holds). The live
  lookahead check projects the same way.

### Changed
- Fleet ortho config distribution is now TUNING-ONLY: the fleet base
  written by Control's Ortho Cache dialog carries just the shared
  priming parameters (enabled, zoom, rings, lookahead, poll rate,
  touch cadence, bandwidth, waypoint aiming, heading offset). Machine
  fields (mount drive, cache size/folder, rclone remote, rc address,
  endpoints) are installer-owned per machine and never distributed —
  previously a full-config fleet base would have overwritten each
  slave's install answers on merge. The dialog was slimmed to match;
  per-machine exceptions use the hostname overlay.
- `fleet_config_dir` no longer defaults to a site-specific UNC path:
  empty (the new default) means fleet distribution is off and the
  agent/Control work purely from the local `ortho_agent.json` without
  touching the network. Set the folder in Control's Ortho Cache dialog
  to enable fleet-wide config.
- `ortho_config` moved from `simpit_control` to `simpit_common` so
  Control's dialog and the ortho agent share the single loader; adds
  `scenery_root()`. Import paths updated (`simpit_control` kept no
  shim — update any external imports to `simpit_common.ortho_config`).
- **`set_scenery_profile`** standard script: rule-based
  `scenery_packs.ini` generator that switches the active Ortho4XP zoom
  level per tile (Z16 vs Z18) from named JSON profiles in
  `<Custom Scenery>/scenery_profiles/` (`vfr`, `ifr`, `hybrid`).
  Profiles support a default zoom plus overrides by explicit tile or by
  airport ICAO + tile radius (resolved via X-Plane's Global Airports
  `apt.dat`, cached). Only ortho lines are touched; timestamped ini
  backup, atomic write, X-Plane-running guard, `--dry-run`, `--status`,
  and `--list` modes. Registered with `cascade=False` because the
  scenery root is a shared NAS folder — revisit if slaves get
  per-machine Custom Scenery.

### Fixed
- Ortho agent: primer reads are now paced (`prime_mbps`, default
  24 MB/s, 0 = off; editable in Control's Ortho Cache dialog) and the
  agent lowers its own CPU/IO priority at startup. Unthrottled
  warm-cache primes ran at raw disk speed, and the 15-35-atlas burst
  at every atlas crossing starved X-Plane's scenery reads on the
  shared cache drive — confirmed live by A/B test as the cause of
  micro-stutters every ~15 s in flight (2026-07-19). Staying ahead of
  the aircraft needs only ~5-8 MB/s sustained, so the cap costs
  nothing.
- Ortho agent: atlas filenames with mixed-case providers now parse —
  the NAS holds ArcGIS atlases (`…_Arc18.dds`, e.g. all 2,543 in
  `Z18_+34-119`/KVNY) alongside Bing's `BI`, and the all-uppercase
  provider regex indexed such folders as empty, leaving the agent
  idle there. Found live at KVNY. A folder with no parseable atlases
  also no longer shadows the other zoom label's folder. Live-verified
  in flight out of KVNY: 8/8 chain checks on the LOCAL RREF feed —
  external visuals serve live position/groundspeed/track matching the
  master, so the localhost default needs no per-machine master IP.
- Control's SCRIPTS panel now scrolls: with many scripts registered,
  rows below the window edge were simply unreachable. Rows live in a
  canvas with an auto-hiding scrollbar and mouse-wheel support, and
  the scroll position survives the dashboard's periodic rebuilds
  (previously it would have snapped to the top every poll tick).

### Planned
- Streaming EXEC_SCRIPT mode wired through to a Control "view full
  output" dialog.
- Slave service installers (`systemd` unit, Windows Task Scheduler XML).
- PyInstaller binaries for Windows users without Python.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-25

Initial alpha release.

### Added

- **`simpit_common`** package
  - JSON-over-{UDP,TCP} protocol with HMAC-SHA256 signing and
    timestamp-based replay protection.
  - Cross-platform OS abstraction (`pathlib`, `psutil`, no Windows-only
    APIs).
  - Extensible probe engine for declarative state queries
    (`path_exists`, `folder_exists`, `file_contains`, `process_running`,
    `script_exit_code`).
  - Atomic key generation, save, and load with POSIX 0600 permissions.

- **`simpit_slave`** package
  - Headless UDP/TCP server with per-connection threading.
  - Buffered + streaming script executor with output-size cap and
    timeout enforcement.
  - Path-traversal rejection in script lookup.
  - Atomic SYNC_PUSH directory swap.
  - STATUS inspector with always-on facts (hostname, os, uptime,
    is_admin, script inventory) plus probe results.
  - First-run interactive key prompt; CLI flags for non-interactive
    deployments.

- **`simpit_control`** package
  - JSON-backed store for slaves and bat files with schema versioning
    and atomic writes.
  - Background poller with subscriber callbacks; only-on-change
    notifications.
  - SlaveLink for outbound UDP/TCP calls with typed error hierarchy.
  - MockLinkProvider with five failure modes (NORMAL, OFFLINE,
    TIMEOUT, BAD_KEY, SLOW) for unit tests and `--debug-fleet` mode.
  - tkinter UI: per-slave status cards with derived state, scripts
    panel with cascade indicators, activity log, security setup dialog.
  - Thread-safe worker→main marshalling via `queue.Queue` with
    periodic main-thread drain.

- **Tests**: 234 passing tests across protocol/security/platform/probes
  (84), slave (46), control core (52), UI (48), and end-to-end
  integration (4).

### Security

- Every wire message is signed; unverified messages are silently
  dropped.
- Slave NEVER accepts a script path containing `/`, `\`, `..`, or NUL.
- Subprocess execution is always `shell=False` with an explicit
  environment whitelist.
- Slaves and Control share a single secret; rotation is
  delete-and-regenerate with no automatic key migration.
